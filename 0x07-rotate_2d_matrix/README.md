# Rotate 2D Matrix

This project contains a Python function that rotates a 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise.

## Description

The function `rotate_2d_matrix(matrix)` takes a 2D matrix as input and rotates it 90 degrees clockwise. The rotation is performed in-place, meaning that no additional data structures are used for the rotation.

## Usage

```python
from rotate_2d_matrix import rotate_2d_matrix

matrix = [[1, 2, 3],
          [4, 5, 6],
          [7, 8, 9]]

rotate_2d_matrix(matrix)
print(matrix)
